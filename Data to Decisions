BADIR FRAMEWORK
BADIR is an acronym for five steps of the Data to Decisions framework. 
The process helps you from determining what questions to ask through the design of your analysis, collection of data, and analysis of data all the way to recommendations for actions that help drive impact on your business. 
I have chosen this approach as it is simple and easily understandable to people without technical backgrounds.


Business Plan --->  Analysis Plan ---> Data Collection --->Derive Indights -->  Recommendations.
